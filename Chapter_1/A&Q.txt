■ Question 1 It is time to do preliminary research based on the documentation [15]. Refer to section 3.4.3
of the first volume to learn about register rflags. What is the meaning of flags CF, AF, ZF, OF, SF? What is the
difference between OF and CF?
CF - carry flag set when arimatc action make carry bit in the msb, indicate of unsinged overflow
AF - Indicates a carry or borrow between the lower nibbl
SF - sign bit lag set if the MSB of the result is 1 indecat on negative number in tow complment
OF - set if arimtc action of two values with the same MSB give results with different MSB, indect on signed overflow
ZF - zero flag set is thr result of arimatic action is 0
the difference between OF and CF is the OF use the indecat overflow on signed values and CF on unsigned valuse  

■ Question 2 What are the key principles of von Neumann architecture? one memory for data and code,one share bus, reade instraction one after one (fach -> decode -> execute) 
■ Question 3 What are registers? small and fast storage inside the cpu 
■ Question 4 What is the hardware stack? the hardware stack is the hardware soppurt on the stack data structure like in x86_x64 - instcrtion push pop ret call,registers rsp rbp 
■ Question 5 What are the interrupts? event that the cpu need to handle them like I/O,syscall/dvi 0
■ Question 6  What are the main problems that the modern extensions of the von Neumann model are trying
to solve? multitasking, preformnce, intrctivity,code support like functions 
■ Question 7 What are the main general purpose registers of Intel 64? rax,rbx,rcx,rdx,rsi,rd,rbp,rsp,r8-r15
■ Question 8 What is the purpose of the stack pointer? to pointg on the top of the stack
■ Question 9 Can the stack be empty? yes
■ Question 10 Can we count elements in a stack? no
