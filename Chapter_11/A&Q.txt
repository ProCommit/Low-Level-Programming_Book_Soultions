■ Question 215 In languages such as C#, code like the following is possible:
var count = 0;
mylist.Foreach( x => count += 1 );
here we launch an anonymous function (i.e., a function which has no name, but whose address can be
manipulated, for example, passed to other function) for each element of a list. The function is written as x =>
count += 1 and is the equivalent of
void no_name( int x ) { count += 1; }
The interesting thing about it is that this function is aware of some of the local variables of the caller and thus
can modify them.
Can you rewrite the function forall so that it accepts a pointer to a “context” of sorts, which can hold an
arbitrary number of variables addresses and then pass the context to the function called for each element?


int count = 0;
forall(struct list *lst,(*fun)(int,void*),void *contect)
